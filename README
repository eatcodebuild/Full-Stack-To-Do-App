FULL STACK TO DO LIST WEB APPLICATION:

    This is a full-stack to-do list application designed to manage tasks efficiently. It provides a clean, responsive user interface with real-time updates, and a powerful backend to store and manage tasks. This application is built using modern web technologies to showcase my skills in full-stack development.

    TECH STACK:
        - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
        - Backend: Node.js with Express.js
        - Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)

    KEY FEATURES:
        - Create, read, update, and delete tasks in real time
        - Persistent task storage using MongoDB
        - RESTful API powered by Express.js for efficient data management
        - Responsive and mobile-friendly design
        - User authentication (optional, if added later)
        - Secure and optimized routing using Node.js

    This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop both the frontend and backend of a full-stack application, integrating user-friendly UI/UX with a robust backend for seamless data management. It also highlights my experience with building, deploying, and maintaining a production-ready web application.
