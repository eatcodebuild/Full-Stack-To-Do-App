## Architecture & Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - Semantic **HTML5** and **CSS3** for markup and styling.  
  - **JavaScript (ES6)** for client-side interactivity.  
  - **EJS** (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine for dynamic server-side rendering.

- **Backend:**  
  - **Node.js** runtime environment.  
  - **Express.js** framework for RESTful API endpoints and routing.  
  - **Express-Session** for managing user authentication and session persistence.  
  - **MongoDB** as a NoSQL database to persist user data and tasks.

- **Deployment:**  
  - Hosted on **Vercel** or similar platforms supporting Node.js applications.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication & Sessions:**  
  - Secure login/logout system using **express-session**, enabling personalized task lists and session management.

- **CRUD Task Management:**  
  - Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks with data persistently stored in MongoDB.

- **Responsive UI:**  
  - Mobile-friendly design that adapts seamlessly across devices.

- **Server-Side Rendering:**  
  - EJS templating enables dynamic content rendering and reduces client load.

- **Secure Routing & Validation:**  
  - Middleware ensures authenticated access to task routes, with input validation and error handling.

## Design & Implementation Highlights

- **Modular Code Structure:**  
  - Clear separation of concerns between routes, views, and database models for maintainability.

- **Session Management:**  
  - Implementation of session cookies and secure user session storage to protect user data.

- **Efficient Database Integration:**  
  - MongoDB used with Mongoose ODM for flexible schema design and easy data operations.

- **Performance & UX:**  
  - Optimized rendering and minimal client-side dependencies to ensure fast user experience.

## Future Enhancements

- Introduce password reset and email verification flows.  
- Add task categorization, priorities, and due dates.  
- Implement automated testing for backend routes and UI components.  
- Upgrade UI with a frontend framework like React for enhanced interactivity.
